# List of thingd I have learned

- <cite> tag
- Using aspect-ratio css property to adjust width & height of images
- position: relative to it's container to position the position: absolute container
- learn using margin: -em ; value to off-set the content weather along with X-axis or Y-axis.
  (here no need to position content unnecessarily to achieve off-set position)
- shaded background- means on a background img place a color on top. this can achieve in 2 ways-
  - in a container backgound: color img; -> background-blend-mode: screen; -> background-size: cover;
  - container::before Pseudo-Elements uses content: " "; width: 100%; height: 100%; ....
- flex-basis & flex-grow will apply on flex items not on flex container.
- If all items have flex-grow: 1; the remaining space will automatically distributed in equal proportion among all children. but If I want to give one of the children a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much space as the others.
